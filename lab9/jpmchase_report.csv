"Consumers’ out-of-pocket spending on healthcare is higher when they have more cash on hand, which suggests that cash flow dynamics may be an important driver of when consumers’ have access to care. In this report, we focus on a special cash flow event—the arrival of a tax refund—to address important and heretofore unanswered questions around the relationship between cash flow and healthcare.",January 2018,How Tax Refunds Enable Healthcare Spending,Deferred Care,2018,1,report
"The aftermath of the Great Recession was a particularly difficult period for many homeowners. Unemployment increased and house prices declined, leaving many homeowners struggling to make their monthly mortgage payments and unable to sell their homes. In this report, the JPMorgan Chase Institute used data on mortgage modifications to measure the impact of reductions in monthly mortgage payments and mortgage principal on default and consumption.  We found that payment reduction was effective in reducing default while principal reduction had no impact on default or consumption, and default was correlated with a considerable loss in income. Our analysis suggests that mortgage modification programs that are designed to target substantial payment reduction will be most effective at reducing mortgage default rates. Modification programs designed to reach affordability targets based on debt-to-income measures without regard to payment reduction or target a specific LTV ratio while leaving borrowers underwater may be less effective at reducing defaults.",December 2017,New Evidence and Implications for Policy,Mortgage Modifications after the Great Recession,2017,12,report
"Nonemployer small business owners who pay for their own health insurance epitomize two poorly understood features of the US economy: the small business sector and the individual health market. The economic experiences of these small business owners can inform both the well-being of the small business sector and the health of a substantial share of the individual health insurance market. We constructed a sample of over 30,000 firms who hold business banking deposit accounts with Chase to produce a monthly view of health insurance premium payments and other operating expenses from January 2014 to April 2017.",November 2017,Dynamics of the Small Business Owner Health Insurance Market,Paying a Premium,2017,11,report
"The future of family-paid healthcare costs rests with healthcare policy choices currently being debated and out-of-pocket costs are a key piece of that picture. The JPMorgan Chase Institute set out to better understand out-of-pocket healthcare spending among US households. Building off a sample of 2.3 million de-identified core Chase customers aged 18 to 64 between 2013 and 2016, we created the JPMorgan Chase Institute Healthcare Out-of-pocket Spending Panel (JPMCI HOSP). We explored the levels, concentration, and growth of out-of-pocket healthcare spending and the implications of these spending trends for overall household financial health. The JPMCI HOSP provides a first-ever look into out-of-pocket healthcare spending for households on a month-to-month basis, at the state, metro, and county level, and as recent as 2016. In this report, we describe the creation of, and initial insights gleaned from, this new data asset.",September 2017,The Healthcare Spending of 2 Million US Families,Paying Out-of-Pocket,2017,9,report
"Extraordinary medical payments have negative impacts on financial outcomes, and this is especially true for women. This brief underscores the importance of efforts to address the gender gap in financial outcomes and reduce debt burdens for women. In addition, should out-of-pocket healthcare costs increase due to changing tax credits or the elimination of essential benefits, women may have to shoulder more of the economic burden of receiving care.",May 2017,The Impact of Medical Payments,The Gender Gap in Financial Outcomes,2017,5,report
"The Great Recession brought to the forefront many unanswered questions about how monetary policy plays out at a microeconomic level, notably the question of how changes in the federal funds target rate impact personal consumption for individual households. In this report, the JPMorgan Chase Institute examines the credit card spending of a sample of US homeowners with an adjustable-rate mortgage to help answer this question. We find that homeowners responded by increasing their spending both in advance of the anticipated drop in their mortgage payment and in the post-reset period, despite a considerable drop in housing wealth. Our analysis further highlights how housing policy that influences the share of fixed-rate mortgages versus variable-rate mortgages can impact the overall effectiveness of monetary policy.",April 2017,Microdata on Monetary Policy,The Consumer Spending Response to Mortgage Resets,2017,4,report
"In recent years, local decision makers have become increasingly concerned with questions of resident access to amenities. In this brief, the JPMorgan Chase Institute focused on access to retail for residents in Detroit and New York.

"Americans across the income spectrum experience tremendous income and expense volatility, and this volatility has been on the rise. In this report, we examine the sources of expense volatility and the changes in financial behavior that coincide with extraordinary medical payments. Integrated, high-frequency data of income, spending, assets, and liabilities shed new light on expense volatility and how behavior changes with this volatility, which is critical to improving policies and solutions to strengthen the financial resilience of American families.",February 2017,Big Data on Expense Volatility and Medical Payments,Coping with Costs,2017,2,report
"Small businesses provide work for nearly half of all employees in the US, but relatively little is known about the underlying dynamics of employment growth and volatility at the individual small business level. In this report, we find that, although most small business owners experience low payroll growth each year, the month-to-month volatility of payroll expenses around that growth can be quite high, making it more difficult for small business owners to manage their cash flows.",January 2017,Big Data on Small Business Payroll Growth and Volatility,The Ups and Downs of Small Business Employment,2017,1,report

"Small businesses are critical to the growth of the U.S. economy, employing nearly half of the U.S. workforce and accounting for 45 percent of U.S. GDP.
